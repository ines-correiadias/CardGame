# CardGame
Group project developed for the Probabilistic Programming course, where we implemented a card game similar to Badugi Poker. Developed together with [Alexandre Silva](https://github.com/alexandre04032000), [João Pedro Gomes](https://github.com/JoaoPedro9400) and [Ricardo Correia](https://github.com/ricardocorreia99).

Implemented in Python, using [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability).
